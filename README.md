Docker config to install Jenkins and JMeter
===========================================

-------------
Usage
-------------

The configuration will install Jenkins and JMeter 3.3. During the setup process, it will create a default user (admin / admin) and a project. The created project, will be linked to the script which runs bin/jmeter.sh and passes as parameters the tests that will be run and the reports we are expecting.

docker-compose.yml lists the ports that will be open (by default 8080 & 50000) and the volumes that will be mounted. The "test" volume is used to store the JMX files that will be executed by JMeter; while "reports" is used to store the output data generated by JMeter.

To bring up the image, run the following:

`docker-compose up`
